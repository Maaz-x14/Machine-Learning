Delete Node by Value:

Description: Delete the first occurrence of a node with a given value in a singly linked list.
Implementation: Traverse the list to find and remove the node with the specified value.
Find Node in Linked List:

Description: Find and return the node with a specific value in a singly linked list.
Implementation: Traverse the list to find the node with the given value.
Merge Two Linked Lists:

Description: Merge two sorted singly linked lists into a single sorted linked list.
Implementation: Traverse both lists and merge nodes while maintaining sorted order.
Remove Duplicates from Linked List:

Description: Remove duplicate nodes from a singly linked list.
Implementation: Use a set to track seen values and remove duplicates as you traverse the list.
Certainly! Here are some beginner-friendly programs for stacks, queues, and linked lists, followed by more advanced ones you can try after practicing.

### Beginner-Friendly Programs

#### **Stacks:**

1. **Reverse a String Using Stack:**
   - **Description:** Use a stack to reverse the characters of a string.
   - **Implementation:** Push each character of the string onto the stack, then pop them off to form the reversed string.

2. **Check for Palindrome Using Stack:**
   - **Description:** Check if a string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward) using a stack.
   - **Implementation:** Push characters onto a stack and compare them with the original string.

#### **Queues:**

1. **Implement a Basic Queue:**
   - **Description:** Implement a basic queue with enqueue and dequeue operations.
   - **Implementation:** Use an array or linked list to manage elements in FIFO order.

2. **Queue Using Array:**
   - **Description:** Implement a queue using a circular array to handle wrap-around.
   - **Implementation:** Use two indices (front and rear) and an array to manage elements in a circular manner.

#### **Linked Lists:**

1. **Basic Operations on Singly Linked List:**
   - **Description:** Implement insert, delete, and display operations for a singly linked list.
   - **Implementation:** Define a `Node` class and a `LinkedList` class with methods for basic operations.

2. **Find the Length of a Linked List:**
   - **Description:** Write a method to find the length of a singly linked list.
   - **Implementation:** Traverse the list and count the number of nodes.

### More Advanced Programs

#### **Stacks:**

1. **Sort Stack Using Another Stack:**
   - **Description:** Sort a stack of integers using another stack.
   - **Implementation:** Use an auxiliary stack to help sort the elements in ascending order.

2. **Evaluate Infix Expressions:**
   - **Description:** Evaluate arithmetic expressions given in infix notation (e.g., `3 + (2 * 5)`).
   - **Implementation:** Use stacks to handle operators and operands, and apply operator precedence.

#### **Queues:**

1. **Implement a Priority Queue:**
   - **Description:** Implement a priority queue where elements are dequeued based on their priority.
   - **Implementation:** Use a heap or a sorted list to manage elements with priorities.

2. **Queue Using Two Stacks:**
   - **Description:** Implement a queue using two stacks for enqueue and dequeue operations.
   - **Implementation:** Use two stacks to reverse the order of elements and simulate queue behavior.

#### **Linked Lists:**

1. **Reverse a Doubly Linked List:**
   - **Description:** Reverse the nodes of a doubly linked list.
   - **Implementation:** Traverse the list and swap the previous and next pointers of each node.

2. **Intersection of Two Linked Lists:**
   - **Description:** Find the node where two linked lists intersect.
   - **Implementation:** Use two pointers to find the intersection point by traversing both lists.
